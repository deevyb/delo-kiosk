# Delo Coffee Kiosk - Project Guide

## Who I'm Building For

**Owner:** Non-technical founder who knows exactly what they want — and wants to understand what's being built. They don't need to make technical decisions, but they want to be an informed partner who learns along the way.

**Communication Rules:**
- Explain technical concepts in plain, accessible language — like talking to a smart friend who doesn't work in tech
- Use judgment on what's worth explaining — focus on meaningful learning moments, not every tiny choice
- When a decision has real trade-offs, share the options, implications, and my recommendation
- Make real-world implications clear: "This means the app will load faster" not "This reduces bundle size"
- The goal is education and transparency, not overwhelm

## Context Preservation (Important!)

This project uses documentation as persistent memory across Claude Code sessions. Auto-compaction and session breaks can lose context, so **these docs are the source of truth**.

### At Session Start
1. Read this entire file (CLAUDE.md)
2. Check the **Current Status** section (bottom of this file) for what's done and what's next
3. If needed, read TECHNICAL.md for implementation details

### At Meaningful Milestones — Update Docs Before Stopping
**What counts as a milestone:**
- Completing a major feature or screen
- Finishing setup/infrastructure work
- Making significant architectural decisions
- Any stopping point where context would be lost

**What to update:**
1. **CLAUDE.md → Current Status section** — Update route statuses, what's done, what's next
2. **TECHNICAL.md** — If any technical details changed (schema, deployment, etc.)
3. **Commit and push** — So updates survive and are visible on GitHub

### Quick Status Update Template
When updating the Current Status section, include:
- Which routes/features are complete vs. in-progress vs. pending
- Any blockers or decisions that need user input
- What the next session should pick up on

## The Business

**Delo Coffee** runs pop-up coffee events 1-2 times per month, serving 100-150 customers per event. Currently using paper order cards where customers circle their choices — it works, but cards get lost or shuffled during busy periods.

**The Problem:** Physical cards get mixed up, leading to order mistakes and confusion about whose drink is whose.

**The Solution:** iPad-based ordering system where customers tap their order, it appears instantly on the kitchen display in perfect order, and nothing can get lost or shuffled.

## The Brand

Delo Coffee is inspired by the *delo* — a traditional Indian courtyard where strangers become friends and everyone belongs. The brand is:

- **Warm & cozy** — like being welcomed into someone's home
- **Playful** — not stuffy or pretentious
- **Heritage-rooted** — honors tradition without being dated

**Colors:**
- Maroon: `#921C12` (primary accent)
- Cream: `#F9F6EE` (backgrounds)
- Dark Navy: `#000024` (text)
- Terracotta: `#C85A2E` (supporting warmth)

**Typography:**
- Yatra One — bold headers, brand name
- Bricolage Grotesque — drink names, buttons
- Roboto Mono — descriptions, details

**Design Principles:**
- Generous white space (like the open courtyard)
- Large tap targets (60x60pt minimum)
- Natural, warm aesthetic
- No generic "café app" look

## The Experience

### Customer Flow (`/order`)
1. See all drinks as a clean grid (no photos for now — elegant text cards)
2. Tap a drink → see applicable modifier options
3. Select modifiers (pre-selected defaults)
4. Enter name (required)
5. Tap "Send"
6. See confirmation with their full order: e.g. "Sarah: Elaichi Latte, Oat Milk, Iced"
7. Screen auto-resets after 3 seconds

### Kitchen Flow (`/kitchen`)
1. Orders appear in real-time, oldest first
2. Each card shows: customer name, drink, modifiers, time since ordered
3. Show counts: "Placed: 5 | Ready: 12"
4. Tap card → "Mark Ready" or "Cancel"
5. Ready orders accumulate in separate section (no need to clear)

### Admin Flow (`/admin`)
1. Enter passcode (owner chooses their own)
2. Three sections:
   - **Menu Items:** Toggle drinks on/off, edit modifiers per item
   - **Modifiers:** Add/edit/delete milk and temperature options
   - **Export:** Download CSV of orders by date range

## Critical Requirements

### Must-Haves
- **Stability above all** — biggest fear is crashes/freezes during rush
- **Beautiful, silky animations** — Framer Motion-style polish throughout
- **Real-time sync** — orders appear instantly on kitchen display
- **Fully editable menu** — nothing hardcoded, everything from admin
- **iPad landscape only** — optimized for this single use case
- **Offline resilience** — graceful handling if WiFi hiccups

### Nice-to-Haves (Later)
- Search/filter on kitchen display
- Drink photos
- More modifier categories

### Out of Scope
- Payments, prices, or totals
- Order numbers or verbal callouts
- Multi-item orders or carts
- Customer accounts or login
- Complex analytics or dashboards

---

## Timeline

**Deadline:** Less than 2 weeks for upcoming pop-up event

**Setup:**
- One iPad for customer ordering
- One iPad/display for kitchen
- 2-person team (owner + helper)
- WiFi usually reliable at venues

## When to Involve the Owner

**Explain and educate when:**
- Making a meaningful technical choice that has real trade-offs worth understanding
- The decision affects what they'll see, feel, or experience
- It's a good learning moment that helps them understand how the app works
- They'd benefit from knowing why something is built a certain way

**Just handle it when:**
- It's a routine technical choice with an obvious right answer
- The decision is purely implementation detail with no user-facing impact
- Explaining it would add complexity without adding understanding

**When presenting decisions:**
- Explain in plain language what each option means
- Make the real-world implications clear
- Give a clear recommendation with reasoning
- Make it easy to say "go with your recommendation" — but also easy to ask questions

---

## Success Criteria

The owner will know this project succeeded when:
1. They get through their next pop-up with zero lost orders
2. The app never crashes or freezes during the rush
3. Customers find it intuitive (no explanation needed)
4. It looks and feels like a natural extension of Delo's brand
5. Every interaction feels smooth and polished
